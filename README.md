# Password-Hash-Cracking-Security-Analysis-Project
This project demonstrates how weak password hashing algorithms can be exploited and why modern security practices are essential. The project focuses on password hash cracking concepts and emphasizes prevention techniques used in real-world systems. 
⚠️ **Note:** This project is for educational and ethical learning purposes only.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how password hashes work
- Analyze risks of weak hashing algorithms
- Learn where attackers use hash cracking
- Study secure password storage techniques

---

## 🧪 Tools & Concepts Used
- Hash cracking concepts (offline analysis)
- Weak hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1)
- Security best practices
- Ethical hacking principles

---

## 🔍 Security Analysis

### Why Weak Hashes Are Dangerous
Weak hashes can be cracked quickly using modern hardware and tools. Once cracked, attackers gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.

### Why MD5 and SHA-1 Should Not Be Used
These algorithms are obsolete and vulnerable to collisions and brute-force attacks. They are no longer recommended for password storage.

### Where Attackers Use Hash Cracking
- Compromised databases  
- Data breaches and leaks  
- Credential stuffing attacks  
- Dark web marketplaces

## 🛡️ Prevention Techniques

- **Salting** – Adds randomness to passwords before hashing  
- **Peppering** – Uses a secret value stored outside the database  
- **bcrypt** – Slow, adaptive password hashing algorithm  
- **Argon2** – Modern, memory-hard hashing algorithm  
- **Rate Limiting** – Prevents brute-force login attempts
